# BroVerse Rag UI - Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Since we hit the API rate limit, please manually create a GitHub repository:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `broverse-rag-ui`
3. Description: "BroVerse Rag - The Ultimate Knowledge Intelligence Platform with document management, knowledge base, and analytics"
4. Set as Public repository
5. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/Users/digitaldavinci/Personal Projects/Convex Rag/broverse-rag-ui"

# Add your GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/broverse-rag-ui.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Confirm project path
# - Link to existing project or create new
# - Configure project settings
```

#### Option B: Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository: `broverse-rag-ui`
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://artful-ibis-284.convex.cloud
   ```
4. Click "Deploy"

### 4. Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in Vercel:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL (https://artful-ibis-284.convex.cloud)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Your Vercel app URL (will be generated after deployment)

### 5. Post-Deployment

After deployment:

1. Visit your Vercel app URL
2. Test the document upload functionality
3. Verify the connection to your Convex backend
4. Check all features are working properly

## üìù Local Development

To run locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your Convex URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://artful-ibis-284.convex.cloud

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Convex Connection Error**
   - Verify your Convex URL in environment variables
   - Ensure your Convex backend is deployed and running
