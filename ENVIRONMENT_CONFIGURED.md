# ✅ Environment Variables Successfully Configured!

## Status: READY FOR DOCUMENT UPLOAD

### Environment Variables Set (via CLI)
- ✅ **PDFCO_API_KEY**: Set in production
- ✅ **VOYAGE_API_KEY**: Set in production

### Documents Cleared
- ✅ All 3 documents deleted from production
- ✅ Ready for fresh upload with proper processing

## Next Steps

### 1. Upload Your Documents
Go to your dashboard and upload your PDFs:
**https://rag-manager-o4cpuaud3-will31s-projects.vercel.app/dashboard/upload**

Upload these files again:
- Principles.pdf
- The-1-Page-Marketing-Plan.pdf  
- Hacking Marketing.pdf

### 2. Monitor Processing
After uploading, wait 1-2 minutes for processing, then run:
```bash
node check-uploaded-docs.js
```

### 3. Verify Success
When documents are properly processed, you should see:
- ✅ Real PDF content in chunks (not placeholder text)
- ✅ All chunks have embeddings: Yes
- ✅ Search queries return relevant results

## What Changed
1. **Environment variables set via CLI** - Both PDF.co and Voyage AI keys are now configured in production
2. **Improved PDF parser** - Better error handling and fallback extraction
3. **Documents cleared** - Ready for fresh processing with proper API keys

## Testing
Once documents are uploaded and processed, test search:
```bash
node test-search.js
```

You should get real search results matching your PDF content!

## Troubleshooting
If documents still don't process correctly:
1. Check logs: `npx convex logs --prod`
2. Verify API keys: `npx convex env list --prod`
3. Test PDF.co directly: `node test-pdfco-api.js`
